# Circuit_Theory_Circuits
My lab materials for Circuit Theory circuits are stored in this repository. Circuit schematics, simulation output, and analysis findings are all included in the files and were produced as a result of my studies.

Each lab file is associated with a unique circuit from the field of circuit theory, and it contains a brief explanation of the circuit's design, operation, and analysis. Network theorems, transient analysis, and frequency response are only a few of the subjects covered in the files, which are arranged according to lab sessions.

These lab files offer a thorough introduction to circuit theory and show how it may be used in real-world situations. They are appropriate for individuals interested in electrical engineering and circuit analysis who are students or hobbyists.
